Randomized saturation designs (@bairdetal2018) offer researchers a way to estimate the diffusion of intervention effects within some geographic or social network. Most approaches work by first cluster-assigning non-overlapping groups of individuals to treatment saturations, then block-assigning individuals to treatment in the proportions determined by the saturations. 

@asunka2019, for example, wanted to know if the presence of election monitors at ballot stations would displace violence and fraud to other ballot stations. They randomized constituencies to low, medium, and high levels of saturation, and then randomized ballot stations to have election monitoring or not in low, medium, or high concentrations, depending on the randomized saturation. In the original study, the authors did not include a zero-saturation condition. Here, we declare a simplified version of their design in which a zero-saturation condition is included. 

Main points to develop:

- Randomized saturation is great when you get the model right. Though, show how IPW reduces the power to detect main effect, especially if there's no spillover.
- Randomized saturation assumes a model that may be wrong. In particular, spillovers are restricted to containers. But this might not be correct.

### Design Declaration

- **M**odel: 
Potential outcomes are defined in terms of `S`---the saturation---and `Z`---whether or not a ballot station is treated. We model spillovers in two ways. In the first, the amount of spillover that affects a unit is determined by how many other units in its network are treated. In the second, the amount of spillover a unit receives is determined by whether that unit's geographic neighbor is treated, irrespective of whether they share a network.

- **I**nquiry: 
We want to know the effect of having high and medium levels of saturation versus low saturation in the control: $E[Y_i(Z_i = 0, S_i = \text{high})-Y_i(Z_i = 0, S_i = \text{low})]$ and $E[Y_i(Z_i = 0, S_i = \text{medium})-Y_i(Z_i = 0, S_i = \text{low})]$. We also want to know the "direct effect"--e.g. what happens to those directly treated if we disregard spillovers. Here it is defined over potential outcomes that the experiment does not reveal, since no one is treated in low-saturation constituencies: $E[Y_i(Z_i = 1, S_i = \text{low})-Y_i(Z_i = 0, S_i = \text{low})]$.  

- **D**ata strategy: We assign entire groups of individual ballot stations to one of three saturations: low (0%), medium (50%), and high (75%). We then randomize individuals within groups to treatment or control in the proportions dictated by the saturation. Thus, the saturation is cluster-randomized, whereas treatment is block-randomized.

- **A**nswer strategy: We weight each individual by the inverse of the probability that they find themselves in the condition they're in. To estimate spillovers, we run one regression comparing high and one regression comparing medium to low saturation control units. To estimate the direct effect, we run a regression of the outcome on the treatment indicatior on the full sample, controlling for saturation.

Here's what our hypothetical country looks like:

```{r}
draw_data(design) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = 1, y = X, color = as.factor(G))) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_discrete("Ballot station") +
  scale_y_continuous("Latitude") +
  scale_x_continuous("Longitude") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = seq(1,N_individuals,by = N_individuals / N_groups) - .5)
```

Let's diagnose

```{r, eval = do_diagnosis & !exists("do_bookdown")}
diagnosis <- diagnose_design(design, sims = sims)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# figure out where the dropbox path is, create the directory if it doesn't exist, and name the RDS file
rds_file_path <- paste0(get_dropbox_path("06_Randomized_Saturation_Designs"), "/diagnosis.RDS")
if (do_diagnosis & !exists("do_bookdown")) {
  write_rds(diagnosis, path = rds_file_path)
}
diagnosis <- read_rds(rds_file_path)
```

Our diagnosis shows this design does a pretty great job, under this model of spillovers:

```{r}
diagnosis %>% reshape_diagnosis() %>% kable()
```

- It's particularly nice, since we're able to estimate the direct effect (whose constitutive POs we never observe) by partialling out spillovers.

- Show here: power tradeoffs for main effects versus spillovers, in terms of 
  proportion of sample allocated to the "low" versus other conditions

- and also in terms of IPW (equivalent sample size with everyone in the .5 condition)


Now, we consider a model of spillovers in which fraud is displaced latitudinally, 
from one neighbor to the next. Say, because there are roads traveling north and 
fraudsters disregard boundaries (in reality, they are unlikely to do so).

```{r}
distal_design <- replace_step(design = design, step = "spillover",
                              new_step = declare_step(next_neighbor = c(N,1:(N-1)),
                                                      spillover_low = Z_S_low[next_neighbor],
                                                      spillover_med = Z_S_med[next_neighbor],
                                                      spillover_high = Z_S_high[next_neighbor],
                                                      handler = fabricate) )
```


```{r, eval = do_diagnosis & !exists("do_bookdown")}
distal_diagnosis <- diagnose_design(distal_design, sims = sims)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
# figure out where the dropbox path is, create the directory if it doesn't exist, and name the RDS file
rds_file_path <- paste0(get_dropbox_path("06_Randomized_Saturation_Designs"), "/distal_diagnosis.RDS")
if (do_diagnosis & !exists("do_bookdown")) {
  write_rds(distal_diagnosis, path = rds_file_path)
}
distal_diagnosis <- read_rds(rds_file_path)
```

- When there are next-neighbor spillovers that ignore boundaries, the estimator is biased again

```{r}
distal_diagnosis %>% reshape_diagnosis() %>% kable()
```
